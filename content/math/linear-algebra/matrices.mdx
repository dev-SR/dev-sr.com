# Matrix Operations and Properties

Matrices are rectangular arrays of numbers that serve as powerful tools for representing linear transformations and solving systems of equations.

## Matrix Multiplication

The product of two matrices $A$ and $B$ is defined when the number of columns in $A$ equals the number of rows in $B$:

$$(AB)_{ij} = \sum_{k=1}^{n} A_{ik}B_{kj}$$

## Identity Matrix

The identity matrix $I$ is the multiplicative identity for matrices:

$$I = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$$

For any matrix $A$: $AI = IA = A$

## Determinant

The determinant of a 2Ã—2 matrix is:

$$\det\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix} = ad - bc$$

```javascript
function determinant2x2(matrix) {
    const [[a, b], [c, d]] = matrix;
    return a * d - b * c;
}

// Example
const matrix = [[3, 2], [1, 4]];
console.log(determinant2x2(matrix)); // Output: 10
```

Matrices form the backbone of linear algebra and are essential for understanding linear transformations.
