    "One of the important and effective techniques for solving a complex problem is divide and conquer. The divide-and-conquer paradigm divides a problem into smaller sub-problems, and then solves these; finally, it combines the results to obtain a global, optimal solution. More specifically, in divide-and-conquer design, the problem is divided into two smaller sub-problems, with each of them being solved recursively. The partial solutions are merged to obtain a final solution. This is a very common problem-solving technique, and is, arguably, the most commonly used approach in algorithm design. Some examples of the divide-and-conquer design technique are as follows:\n",
